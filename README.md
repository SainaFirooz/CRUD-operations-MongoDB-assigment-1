Assignment 1

Problem description:

Create a command line application in Node which connects to a MongoDB database and performs
CRUD operations.
Write a node application that presents a text based menu to the user. The menu items should be
numbered. The user should choose a menu item by entering a number that corresponds to the menu
item.

The grade G

For the grade G implement the following menu:

1. View all movies
2. Add a new movie
3. Update a movie (Update title, director or release date)
4. Delete a movie
5. Exit

The user should be able to perform the CRUD operations on movies. When it comes to updating a
movie the user should be able to update the fields title, director and release date.


The grade VG

For the grade VG you should add more functionality to the Update a movie menu item. The user
should be able to update the fields genres, ratings and cast. The user should be able to add an
element to these arrays or remove an element from them. You have to design the menu and the
feedback to the user so that the user knows what is expected of them. You have to assume that the
user does not know anything about what your application does and how it works. It is better to give
too much feedback to the user the too little. If the user gets too little feedback they will not know
how to use the application.
